# Rhythmbox-Wrapped

This small script lets you create a summary of how you've been using the program [Rhythmbox](http://www.rhythmbox.org/) on your computer. This script takes the Rhythmbox program data as inputs and creates an image displaying some information, such as:
* How long you've been listening to music with Rhythmbox
* How many songs have you been listening on Rhythmbox
* What are the first and second most listened song on your playlist in Rhythmbox
